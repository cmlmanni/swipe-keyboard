# Speaack – AI-Enabled Swipe Keyboard Demo for MND Users

**Speaack** is a prototype interface designed to explore how AI-driven text prediction can support users with **Motor Neuron Disease (MND)** in everyday digital communication. This repository hosts a **demo version of the software component**, focusing on a **context-aware swipe keyboard** that predicts the next word or sentence using OpenAI's language model.

## ✨ Project Overview

### 🎯 Rationale

People with MND often face progressive loss of motor control and speech, making conventional typing or communication tools difficult to use. While **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)** systems are widely used, many remain rigid or require significant effort to operate.

**Speaack** proposes a lightweight alternative — not a replacement for AAC, but a **complementary tool** that:

- Enables **context-aware predictive typing** through swipe input
- Reduces cognitive and physical strain by offering **smart suggestions**
- Can be adapted to physical interfaces (e.g. large buttons, minimal screen taps)

By combining a **swipe-friendly keyboard interface** with **AI-powered language prediction**, the project explores how to make communication more fluid, expressive, and accessible for MND users.
